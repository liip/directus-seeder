# Seeder for Directus

## Introduction

Seeder for Directus is a simple package using knexjs and the directus API to seed directus with (dummy) data.

## Example

Here is an example of a seed file.

```js
const { seed } = require('directus-seeder');
const { Directus } = require('@directus/sdk');

exports.seed = async function (knex) {
    const items = [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Item 1",
            "description": "This is the first item",
           "image": "file:./images/item1.jpg",
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Item 2",
            "description": "This is the second item",
            "image": "file:./images/item2.jpg",
        },
    ];
    
    const directus = new Directus('http://localhost:8055', {
        auth: {
            staticToken: 'STATIC_TOKEN',
        },
    });

     // If you want to use email and password. You should remove the staticToken above and use the following line.
     // await directus.auth.login({ email, password })
   
    await seed(knex, directus, 'items', items, {
        clearTableEntries: true,
        fileRoot: __dirname
    })
};
```

## Installation

1. Install Seeder for Directus with the following command

   ```
   npm install directus-seeder
   ```
   
2. Make Sure that the [directus SDK](https://docs.directus.io/reference/sdk/) and [knexjs](https://knexjs.org/) are installed.

3. Create a `knexfile.js` by using the following command

   ```
   knex init
   ```

   The `knexfile.js` will contain the configuration of your database.  
   For more information visit the [offical knexjs documentation](https://knexjs.org/).

## Create a seed

You can create a new seed file with the following command

```
knex seed:make seed_name
```

By default, the seed file will be created in the `/seeds` directory.
You can set a different directory in the `knexfile.js` file.

##Â Available helper functions
### `seed()`

The seed function should be called like this:

```js
const { seed } = require('directus-seeder');

await seed(knex, directus, 'table_name', entries, {
   clearTableEntries: true,
   fileRoot: __dirname
})
```

The seed function will take the following parameters:

* **knex** (`Knex`): instance of knexjs
* **directus** (`IDirectus<TypeMap>`): authenticated directus instance

  Your authenticated directus instance should look like this:

   ```js
   const { Directus } = require('@directus/sdk');
   
   const directus = new Directus('http://localhost:8055', {
       auth: {
           staticToken: 'STATIC_TOKEN',
       },
   });
   ```

   If you want to use email and password. You should remove the staticToken above and use the following line.

   ```js
   await directus.auth.login({ email, password })
   ```
  
* **tableName** (`string`): the name of the table
* **entries** (`object[]`): the data to be inserted

  This argument should be an array of objects:

   ```js
   const items = [
      {
         id: 1,
         name: 'Item 1',
         description: 'This is the first item',
         image: 'file:./images/item1.jpg',
      },
      {
         id: 2,
         name: 'Item 2',
         description: 'This is the second item',
         image: 'file:./images/item1.jpg',
      },
   ];
   ```

   Use `file:./path/to/file` to handle files. The path should be relative to the directory where the seed command is executed.
   If the `fileRoot` option is set, the path needs to be defined relative to the given `fileRoot`.
   The file will be uploaded via the directus api and the correct file id will be added to the database entry.   


* **options** (`object`)
  * **clearTableEntries** (`boolean`): If enabled, the table will be cleared before inserting the data.
  * **fileRoot** (`string`): When defined `file:` paths are being resolved relative to the given `fileRoot`. By default, the directory in which the seed command is executed is used to generate the file path. 


## Execute seed

You can run the seed file with the following command

```
knex seed:run --specific=seed_name.js
```

or you can run all the seeds in alphabetical order with the following command

```
knex seed:run
```
